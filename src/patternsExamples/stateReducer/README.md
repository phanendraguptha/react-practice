# Definition

The State Reducer pattern in React is a design approach that allows you to manage state logic in a more flexible and reusable way. It involves using a reducer function to handle state transitions, making it easier to manage complex state logic and enabling custom state transitions.

## Implementation Details

The `StateReducer.tsx` file demonstrates the State Reducer pattern by defining a custom hook, `useToggle`, that manages the state of a toggleable component. It includes:

- **State**: An object representing the current state of the toggle.
- **Action**: An object representing the type of action to be performed on the state.
- **Reducer Function**: A function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state based on the action type.
- **Custom Reducer**: An optional custom reducer function that can override the default state transitions.

The `useToggle` hook uses the `useReducer` hook to manage the state and provides functions to toggle and reset the state. It also allows passing a custom reducer to modify the state transitions.

The `StateReducer` component demonstrates the usage of the `useToggle` hook with both the default and custom reducers.

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Allows consumers to customize state update logic without modifying the original component.

2. **Reusability**: The base component remains generic while allowing specific implementations to have custom behavior.

3. **Predictability**: State changes are handled through a single reducer function, making the flow of state updates more predictable and easier to debug.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Separates state management logic from UI components, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

5. **Extensibility**: Makes it easy to add new state transitions or modify existing ones without changing the core component logic.
